# Artisnally Handcrafted Wedding  WebApp
>I used to think a wedding was a simple affair. Boy and girl meet, they fall in love, he buys a ring, she buys a dress, they say I do. I was wrong. That's getting married. A wedding is an entirely different proposition. <br> <br>
>George Banks, Father of the Bride (1991)
